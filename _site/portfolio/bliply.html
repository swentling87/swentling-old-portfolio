<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>Bliply is a social networking application that allows users to follow locations, follow interests, add friendships, write posts (which auto-destruct after 7 days) and maintain their privacy through Bliply’s “stealth mode”. This was my first independent project as a developer and served as the capstone project in my Rails Web Development track with Bloc.</p>

<h3 id="explanation">Explanation</h3>

<p>This particular project was not one of the eight available independent projects under the Rails Web Development track at Bloc but was an my own creation and served as my capstone in the course. In creating Bliply I had to carefully design user stories, create mockups and ultimately design both the back-end and front-end of the entire application. Working with my mentor I used the Kanban approach to manage the project and worked to a deadline based on which features had been selected for that sprint. To manage each sprint I used Trello and kept track of my progress as well as new features, bugs or corrections to review with my mentor.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>

<p>Creating Bliply was easily the most challenging but rewarding project of this course and definitely has tested my patience, tenacity and skills as it was my first independent project. Most of all though, this project showed me that I can actually take an idea from theory and put it into production from start to finish and that’s a first. From a functional perspective, I find Bliply to be a success as it is a fully functioning application written under TDD conditions, it passes all RSPEC tests and is live on Heroku. For being a course about back-end development I feel the progress can be seen from project to project (Bloccit, Blocmarks, Bliply). As this was the third project, it also featured the most complex code featuring multiple models interacting with the User model, self-referring modeling for Friendships and Polymorphic associations for Posts all while also featuring a “stealth” mode which required significant work to either show or restrict information depending on the relationship between the users.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>As Bliply was my first personal creation I am again very proud of it, I. This project even more than the others turned out to be extremely instructive, more of a challenge and even more rewarding as this showed me that I can not only develop my own application but that I can work with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, utilize new gem’s and their API’s, complex modeling arrangements but more importantly that I could solve problems that I had never faced and reach a comprehensive and coherent solution.</p>
