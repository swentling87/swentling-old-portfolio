<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>Blocitoff is a self-destructing personal checklist application that allows users to create and manage items for a to-do list and was created with the help of a loose framework from the Bloc curriculum. This was my fourth project developed with my mentor for educational purposes during the end of my Rails Web Development track during spare time and then re-developed in Angular during the frontend portion of my development track using Angular and Firebase.</p>

<h3 id="explanation">Explanation</h3>

<p>This particular project was one of the eight available independent projects under the Rails Web Development track at Bloc of which a student selects two to work on during the course. In creating this program the course provides a loose framework of user stories it expects to have implemented and some suggestions but ultimately allows for greater freedom in the actual creation of the code itself and implementing the approach.</p>

<p>After completion of the Rails Web development track the front end course then also has a version of this project that calls for recreating it in Angular with Firebase.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>

<p>As this project was my fourth RoR application and had similar components to previous work it was the fastest and most approachable of my creations to date but not without challenges. The code was kept simple but fitting to the requirements of the assignment to expedite the process and similarly the design was kept minimal particularly as this was an exercise in backend development. From a functional perspective the code works and is user friendly so I do indeed feel that it is a success. The aforementioned challenge in this project wasnâ€™t so much any issue with the project itself but in working with AJAX as this was only lightly touched upon in previous curriculum. In the end though, I was able to get it working for the destroy function per the requirements of the assignment and gained more familiarity with AJAX overall.</p>

<p>Then in re-creating the program in Angular I added some interesting css effects with a changing background that alternates between a set of images and otherwise kept the UI rather simple taking a similar approach to my bloc-chat project.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>As this project was my fourth  creation and by far the quickest it has definitely helped increase my confidence after working on Bliply for some time. This project in particular turned out to be more of a good practice project yet still instructive as I had the opportunity to work more with AJAX.</p>

<p>Remaking this project in Angular while it held its own challenges was not particularly hard and more served to reinforce my knowledge around angular and served its purpose as such.</p>
