  <section class="post-content"><p>So it seems like I have been radio silent for some time now. And boy have I been busy! Between handling Injury Claims in my full-time job and then working on projects for my employer Phantom Design and studying Software Engineering Principles through Bloc I have definitely had a lot on my plate. But in a good way!</p>

<p>The majority of this time as I mentioned, has been doing some work above and beyond my standard 40hrs in insurance. I recently completed an assignment building a new responsive landing page and download page for a client in preparation for their launch in a new market. Started with a clean slate and got a chance to really build something to be proud of. Something production worthy. I constructed a new responsive header and footer system, built out the page with responsive elements both using Bootstrap but also my own code in some places. Then in the backend I got to clean up and partially re-write a fair amount to allow for some needed flexibility and got a chance to work further with the Stripe API hacking together a new and improved payments form. Overall, that assignment and some various debugging for our client on other aspects of the codebase has kept me busy! But as I mentioned, in a good way! Great in fact.</p>

<p>And then with Bloc I’m moving into Software Engineering Principles and learning about Data Structures at the moment. Not just how to use an array or a hash but actually how to define and build things like a linked list in Ruby, stacks, queues and how the examine the underlying mechanics of a hash. So definitely different and very interesting stuff! Next will be Algorithm design, some further DB work and then a deeper dive into Framework Architecture and Design Patterns. Excited!</p>

<p>So… That’s what I’ve been up to. I’ll be taking some time to write on a few topics shortly from a technical perspective as well. Stay tuned!</p>
