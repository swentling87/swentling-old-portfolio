        <p>Ok now for something new… I wrote some <a href="http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#skills/search/swentling/?&amp;ref-suffix=sb_gw">skills</a> for the Amazon Echo! They’re a little basic from the standpoint that they’re not any groundbreaking creation and yet they’re my first published applications for a major platform, so it’s pretty exciting!! And on top of that, within the first day I have a five-star review on one which I’m just absolutely amazed by.</p>

        <p>So far everything has been Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS and a little jQuery thrown into the mix for fun. And boy have I been <strong>spoiled…</strong> because as part of the FrontEnd portion of my Software Engineering Track with <a href="http://www.bloc.io">Bloc</a> they have me learning JavaScript and Angular. Now it’s not really that bad, at least this time around I’ve got some coding experience under my belt and I’m just learning a new language and framework rather than a whole new way of thinking. But with that said, I definitely have gained an appreciation for the wonders of Ruby.</p>

        <p>Ok so there’s a new project on my portfolio here called the Geo-Location challenge. This was a unique project as I got my first chance to work with Google API’s and it’s funny because I tried initially to work with strictly integrating JS directly into my Rails App. And while it is a bit odd when writing in HAML it is still <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9744169/include-inline-js-in-haml">possible</a>. But <em>no one</em> seemed to be doing that. Every reference I found simly said to use the gem <a href="https://github.com/apneadiving/Google-Maps-for-Rails">gmaps4rails</a> and I’ve got to say that I’m definitely a fan. If I ever need to use Gmaps again on a rails app, it makes your life quite easy. If it ain’t broke, why fix it? Right?!</p>

        <p>Well. Let me tell you, I have been up to my elbows in JavaScript learning some vanilla JS and expanding my knowledge in jQuery all while holding down a job as a superb claims specialist and networking in the local coding community. Now on to the topic of JavaScript… I must concede that it may not be my favorite language that I have had exposure to so far, but it does seem to have its benefits and do some pretty interesting stuff. Yet still, some Ruby on Rails with a little jQuery can do an awful lot as far as I’m concerned and I know that I have only scratched the surface so far. It’s a decently deep scratch, but not enough in my eyes. I want <strong>more!</strong></p>

        <p>So… I recently had a mock-interview with my mentor that was probably equal parts successful and awkward. In large part it was because this was a very different interview from what I have ever experienced in the past. I can sell you a stapler based on the merits of its color, type and function any day. I can explain in detail a time that I overcame an obstacle or difficult situation at work, how I approached the problem and what the outcome was any day. But to explain what an object is?? Well I know what it is, but put on the spot it was hard to describe. It was like someone asking me to describe the word <strong>the</strong>. I know what is is and how to use it but just sort of took it for granted. In retrospect I can look back now and say, “Duh! An object is an instance of a class.” and “A class is a description or template of what an object could be.” At the time however while the coffee that morning hadn’t made it to my brain yet I was found stumbling around for an answer…. And boy am I glad about that! Because at least now I know slightly what to expect.</p>

        <p>So… I’m a Software Developer now. Kind of hard to wrap my head around that, but the fact is that I have developed software and continue to do so, not as a hobby but as a passion. That makes me a developer. I’ve held the label of student, athlete, server, bartender, banker, manager, claims adjuster, boyfriend and fiancee but this is all new. The aspect that stands out the most to me though is not that it’s a new label but that as a developer this is the first time that I have ever <strong>created</strong> anything new. In my previous roles I have either sold something that someone else created, or followed recipes, work-flows or guides. And yes there is still a formulaic aspect to parts of this yet more than ever before I get to create and be creative. At the end of the day there is something to show for the work that I’ve done, I can actually see a result and that is a great feeling.</p>
