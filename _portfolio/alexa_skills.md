### Summary

I created three Amazon Alexa skills over the span of a couple of days and they're published in the Alexa Skill marketplace for everyones enjoyment!

### Explanation

The first application was pretty straight forwards, it is called World Currencies which is a trivia game to teach you about world currencies.

My second application while similar was slightly different as it has a database of facts and can recite them as often as requested. Called Weird Laws, it is a collection of weird laws that exist in the United States.

And for my third application, I created Chance Dice which is a random number generator that simulates rolling dice with options for 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, 100 sided dice.
