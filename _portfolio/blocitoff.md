### Summary

Blocitoff is a self-destructing personal checklist application that allows users to create and manage items for a to-do list and was created with the help of a loose framework from the Bloc curriculum. This was my fourth project developed with my mentor for educational purposes during the end of my Rails Web Development track during spare time.

### Explanation

This particular project was also (like Blocmarks) one of the eight available independent projects under the Rails Web Development track at Bloc of which a student selects two to work on during the course. In creating this program the course provides a loose framework of user stories it expects to have implemented and some suggestions but ultimately allows for greater freedom in the actual creation of the code itself and implementation approach.

### Results

As this project was my fourth RoR application and had similar components to previous work it was the fastest and most approachable of my creations to date but not without it’s own challenges. The code was kept simple but fitting to the requirements of the assignment to expedite the process and similarly the design was kept minimal particularly as this was an exercise in backend development. From a functional perspective the code works and is user friendly so I do indeed feel that it is a success. The aforementioned challenge in this project wasn’t so much any issue with the project itself but in working with AJAX as this was only lightly touched upon in previous curriculum. In the end though, I was able to get it working for the destroy function per the requirements of the assignment and gained more familiarity with AJAX overall.

### Conclusion

As this project was my fourth coding creation and by far the quickest it has definitely helped increase my confidence after working on Bliply for some time. This project in particular turned out to be more of a good practice project yet still instructive as I had the opportunity to work more with AJAX.
