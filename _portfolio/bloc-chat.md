### Summary

Bloc Chat is an online chat room application created with Angular 1.5.7 and Firebase. This project developed with my mentor for educational purposes during the Frontend Web Development portion of my Software Engineering Track.

### Explanation

Bloc Chat was a project created with a loose framework and some starter code but ultimately was created of my own design utilizing Bootstrap UI, Angular Cookies, UI Router, Firebase and AngularFire. The design was to have the program prompt a user for a username upon their first access and then allow them to both join existing chat rooms and post or create new rooms and post messages.

### Results

This project was my second experience with Angular and my first using Firebase. From a functional perspective the code works, I think it has good design aspects, it accomplishes the goal of the project and is a success. I took the opportunity to add some design elements I thought would be appropriate and I like the end product. I could see using this if I didn't already have so many messaging applications that I use. Overall this project was definitely instructional and it served to further enhance my skills with Angular.

### Conclusion

As Bloc Chat was another experience with Angular, it has definitely been a valuable project to work on and further developed my skills and for that reason alone, I'm glad I did it.
