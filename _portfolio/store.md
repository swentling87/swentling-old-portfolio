### Summary

The Store is a (fake) store, created as an educational experiment, exercise and potential template. This was my fifth project and first to be developed with no help or review from my mentor. It has a fully functional shopping cart system as well as an order placing system for the amazing robots available for sale. (not really for sale)

### Explanation

This project is an independent project created after my Rails Web Development track at Bloc created as more of an intellectual exercise to keep learning Rails more in depth and experiment with adding more design elements and jQuery. This was an entirely new creation done with no direction, no framework and of my own design. In particular, I like this project because more than any prior projects it allowed for more experimentation on the front-end side and served to reinforce some concepts that I have learned.

### Results

As my first project created with the sole purpose of making more of a statement in a visual sense, I have to say that it was a success. The store introduced me to some new concepts as I created a shopping cart with some <a href="https://richonrails.com/articles/building-a-shopping-cart-in-ruby-on-rails">help</a> and tried out some new ways of using jQuery, CSS and gems like Faker. To date I would say this is also my most production-ready work and is easily the most compelling as it combines a variety of languages to create a coherent application that can be built upon and expanded over time.

### Conclusion

From an instructive sense, this project was invaluable as it really helped to cement some concepts for me and show that I could build something again from start to finish on my own. Functionally though I realize there are some different directions this could have been taken and on a further iteration I would consider adding some functionality from something like Stripe or Shoppify and perhaps a mailer system confirming orders placed.
