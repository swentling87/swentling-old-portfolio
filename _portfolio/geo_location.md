### Summary

This project was a challenge project specifically created to address a problem posed to me and create a functioning application based on a set of instructions/requirements. This was my sixth project and was again instructive as I learned a lot about integrating scripts and JS within a Rails application. Initially I began with a strict focus on JS working through the Google Maps API but settled on using the <a href="https://github.com/apneadiving/Google-Maps-for-Rails">Gmaps4Rails</a> gem to facilitate the functionality that I was looking for and after some fiddling with TurboLinks ultimately accomplished my goal.

### Explanation

This project is an independent project created as an intellectual exercise to keep learning Rails more in depth and to specifically answer a challenge posed to me. The challenge specifically requests that the application accept a tab delimited file, parse the information and store it in the database then display each location ordered by distance from a specified location. Bonus points included the use of TDD, Google Maps, Ruby and Rails.

### Results

In the sense that the challenge which was presented to me has been met and the goals accomplished, I must say that this project is a success. This challenge introduced me to some new concepts as I used the CSV functionality of Ruby, worked through the Google Maps API and ultimately used a new gem!

### Conclusion

From an instructive sense, this project was invaluable as it really helped to cement some concepts for me and show that I could build something again from start to finish on my own. And from a functional sense it works for the particular instance that it is needed. Should the TSV file have different data or requirements it can then be easily modified as needed.
