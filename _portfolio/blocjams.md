### Summary

BlocJams is a personal music player application that allows a user to simply listen to music. This project developed with my mentor for educational purposes during the Frontend Web Development portion of my Software Engineering Track.

### Explanation

BlocJams has been a unique project as it was not only a guided project but available as a non-guided project and also as a secondary project with the addition of metrics visualization with D3 and NVD3. In the first portion of creating this program the course provides a detailed framework to create it using plain JavaScript. Then it provides a loose framework which provides direction on re-creating the application with Angular JS and ultimately a second project with even less direction which adds metrics for visualization of song plays.

### Results

This project was my first true JavaScript application and experience with Angular. From a functional perspective the code works, I think it has good design aspects, it accomplishes the goal of the project and is a success. Overall this project was quite instructional as it served to introduce me to not only a new perspective on development but also experience the same project from different perspectives having created twice.

### Conclusion

As BlocJams was my first full coding creation outside of Ruby on Rails it was unique in the fact that it made me get outside of my comfort zone but still helped increase my confidence in my skills and knowledge while reinforcing concepts from a new viewpoint.
