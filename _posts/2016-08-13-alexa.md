Ok now for something new... I wrote some <a href="http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#skills/search/swentling/?&ref-suffix=sb_gw">skills</a> for the Amazon Echo! They're a little basic from the standpoint that they're not any groundbreaking creation and yet they're my first published applications for a major platform, so it's pretty exciting!! And on top of that, within the first day I have a five-star review on one which I'm just absolutely amazed by.

The first application was pretty straight forwards, I created <a href="http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#skills/dp/B01K3U5B8W/?ref=skill_dsk_skb_sr_1">World Currencies</a> which is a trivia game to teach you about world currencies.

The second application while similar was slightly different as it has a database of facts and can recite them as often as requested. Called <a href="http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#skills/dp/B01K742NQC/?ref=skill_dsk_skb_sr_0">Weird Laws</a> it is a collection of weird laws that exist in the United States.

And now for my third completed application which is currently ~~awaiting certification~~ certified(08/16/2016)! It is called <a href="http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html#skills/dp/B01KAIYYG2/?ref=skill_dsk_skb_sr_0">Chance Dice</a> and is a random number generator which simulates rolling dice with options for 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, 100 sided dice. ~~Having just submitted it today, it should go live in the next couple of days depending on when the certification gets completed.~~ And now that it's live on the Alexa skills site, it is up and ready to use for any and all dice rolling endeavors you may have.
