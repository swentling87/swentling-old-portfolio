Well I took awhile to get to this.... but for good reason! I've been pulling double-duty still working insurance claims and lots of dev projects for Phantom Design. Just completed work on the sales funnel for a client's new product launch, a new product feature and squashing bugs left and right! Then for Bloc.io I just completed a custom re-build of ActiveRecord and Rails.

Lots going on! I'd love to write more, but gotta get back to work. Hopefully after some product launch I'll be able to display some of my handiwork soon... So keep checking back!
